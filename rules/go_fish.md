# Go Fish

Rules of Go Fish, as specified by [Bicycle Cards](https://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/go-fish/)

## Players

Between 2 to 5 players can play.

## Cards

The game is played with a standard 52 card deck.

Aces are high.

Only rank/pip is important- suit is not considered.

## Purpose

A 'book' is 4-of-a-kind. The purpose of the game is to get the most books, with each one
being worth 1 point.

If at any time a player has a book within their hand, they must remove it from their hand
and place it face up. It is then considered out of play.

## Dealing

If 2-3 players, deal each 7 cards.

If 4-5 players, deal each 5 cards.

The remaining cards should be face down in the 'sea'.

If a player has any complete 'books' after the deal, they must place them face up and take
them out of play.

## The Play

Player A selects one card (Card A) from their hand.

Player A selects another player (Player B) from the game.

Player A requests all cards matching the rank of Card A from Player B.

If Player B does have a match, they must give all matching cards to Player A, and Player A begins
a new play

If Player B does not have any matches, Player A must 'go fish' and pull a card from the 'sea'.

If Player A 'makes a catch' or draws a card of the rank they were requesting, they begin a new
play.

If not, their turn is over
